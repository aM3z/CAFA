We would like to use statistical and machine learning techniques to predict "everything that happens to or through a protein."[1]

## Learning Algorithms

### Neural Network with Stochastic Gradient Descent

## Data set
This data set must contain at least two pieces of information for each protein: its sequence and its known function. We can seperate it into two parts:
1. Training Set
2. Validation Set
