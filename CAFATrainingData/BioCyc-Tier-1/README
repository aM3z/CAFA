Parsed BioCyc data file README
------------------------------

Each parsed file are named as xxx_parsed.dat, where 'xxx' is the database name. These files are Tab Separated Value (tsv) file with 2 fields.

List of fields:
---------------

Column No. Content:
1. Unique database ID (1)
2. GO annotation (1+)

The numbers in the parentheses indicate the occurrence of that field. Multiple occurrences are separated by a semicolon ';'.

For the second field (GO annotation), each annotation consists of 3 parts: 1) GO term ID; 2) GO namespace (F = Molecular Function; P = Biological Process; C = Cellular Component); 3) Evidence code.

These 3 parts are separated by a single comma. If multiple evidence codes were attached to a single GO annotation, they were separated by a vertical bar; e.g. GO:0016226,P,IGI|IMP;
