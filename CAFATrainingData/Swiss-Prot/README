Parsed UniProt Swiss_Prot data file README
------------------------------------------

This parsed file is a Tab Separated Value (tsv) file with 4 fields.

List of field:
-------------

Column No. Content:
1. UniProtKB ID (1)
2. NCBI Taxon ID (1)
3. UniProtKB Accession (1+)
4. GO annotation (1+)

The number in the parentheses indicate the occurrence of that field. Multiple occurrences are saparated by a semicolon ';'.

For the 4th field (GO annotation), each annotation consists of 3 parts: 1) GO term ID; 2) GO namespace (F = Molecular Function; P = Biological Process; C = Cellular Component); 3) Evidence code. These 3 parts are separated by a single comma; e.g. GO:0005525,F,IDA

As usual, multiple annotations are separated by a semicolon.
