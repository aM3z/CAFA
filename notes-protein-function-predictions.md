# Notes: Protein Function Prediction

Protein funcion basically is "everything that happens to or through a protein" during its lifetime.

## Ontologiical Annotation of Proteins
Different ontologies describe different aspects of a protein's activity. The Gene Ontology (GO) framework (http://geneontology.org/) classifies functions along three aspects:
+ Molecular Function Ontology (MFO)
+ Biological Process Ontology (BPO)
+ Cellular Component Ontology (CCO)

## Data Representation
Proteins consist of up to 20 amino acids (with some exception). Therefore, they can represented as strings of 20 symbols; Î£ = {A, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, V,
W, Y}. Graphs and networks can also be used to represent them. Furthermore, we can also look at proteins as time series data.
